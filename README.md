# 🏗️ AWS Infrastructure Migration Project using Terraform

This repository contains an end-to-end project for migrating and managing AWS infrastructure using **Terraform**, including **importing existing resources**, **state management**, and extending the setup for **drift detection and notifications**.

It documents the process of provisioning infrastructure, importing existing AWS resources into Terraform, managing Terraform state files, resolving challenges, and setting up CI/CD pipelines or AWS Lambda for monitoring.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

✅ The infrastructure was initially provisioned using Terraform scripts in a folder named `terraform_old`.

✅ Later, a migration effort was performed to import existing AWS resources into a new Terraform-managed state in `terraform_new`, using:

- `terraform import`
- a **Python automation script**
- [`Terraformer`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer)

✅ Finally, state files were merged to have a consolidated view of the infrastructure under Terraform management.

---

## 🏗️ **Phases of the Project**

### 1️⃣ **Initial Provisioning (`terraform_old/`)**

- Infrastructure was first provisioned manually with Terraform in a folder called `terraform_old`.
- This included resources like:
  - VPC
  - Subnets
  - Security Groups
  - EC2 Instances
  - RDS
  - EKS Cluster

✅ The infrastructure was successfully deployed using Terraform.

---

### 2️⃣ **Resetting State for Migration**

- To simulate a migration of existing infrastructure, the Terraform state was deleted (by removing `terraform.tfstate`), leaving the infrastructure deployed in AWS but **untracked by Terraform.**

📝 **Goal:** re-import these resources back into Terraform management.

---

### 3️⃣ **New Project Setup (`terraform_new/`)**

A new folder `terraform_new/` was created to manage the same infrastructure:

✅ New Terraform configuration files were written:
- `main.tf`
- `variables.tf`
- `outputs.tf`
- `provider.tf`
- `terraform.tfvars`

### 💡 **Opportunity for Improvement:**

👉 The Terraform configuration can be further modularized by splitting resources into modules:
- `modules/network`
- `modules/compute`
- `modules/database`
- `modules/eks`

This would improve **reusability, scalability, and maintainability.**

---

## 📥 **Importing Existing Resources**

We used **three approaches** to import existing AWS resources:

---

### 4️⃣ **A. Using `terraform import` command**

✅ Each resource was imported manually:

```bash
terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-xxxxxxxx
terraform import aws_subnet.a subnet-xxxxxxxx
terraform import aws_instance.ec2["web1"] i-xxxxxxxx
...
````

🔍 This approach required mapping every resource to its Terraform configuration.

---

### 5️⃣ **B. Using a Python Script for Automation**

✅ A Python script `import_script.py` was created to automate `terraform import` commands for multiple resources.

🔗 This reduced manual effort, but still required prior knowledge of resource IDs.

---

### 6️⃣ **C. Using Terraformer**

We also used [`Terraformer`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer) — a tool that automatically generates Terraform configuration and state from existing infrastructure.

Installed Terraformer and verified version:

```bash
terraformer --version
```

Ran import command for AWS S3:

```bash
terraformer import aws \
  --resources=s3 \
  --regions=us-east-1 \
  --profile=default \
  --output generated \
  --path-pattern "{output}/{provider}/{service}" \
  --compact \
  -O hcl
```

✅ Generated `.tf` and `terraform.tfstate` files under `generated/aws/s3/`.

---

## 🗃️ **Merging State Files**

We had two state files:

1. `terraform.tfstate` → tracked by Terraform in `terraform_new`
2. `generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate` → generated by Terraformer

### 🛠️ We merged these by:

✅ Listing Terraformer state:

```bash
terraform state list -state=generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate
```

✅ Moving Terraformer resources into main state:

```bash
terraform state mv \
  -state=generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate \
  'aws_s3_bucket.tfer--1-terrraform-migration' \
  'aws_s3_bucket.buckets["1-terrraform-migration"]'
```

✅ Verified merged state:

```bash
terraform state list
```

## ⚠️ **Challenges Faced & Resolutions**

| Issue                                                       | Resolution                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fork/exec : no such file or directory` running terraformer | Ensured `terraformer` binary was in `PATH` and executable  |
| Errors in `terraform state mv` with index brackets          | Added single quotes to resource addresses                  |
| State merge `lineage` error                                 | Used manual state movement instead of direct `state push`  |
| `.terraform` provider binaries too large for GitHub push    | Added `.terraform/` to `.gitignore` and reinitialized repo |
| Lambda `environment Variables` JSON parsing error           | Used `env.json` file instead of inline JSON string         |
| Lambda role `cannot be assumed`                             | Updated trust policy for `lambda-execution-role`           |
| Lambda permission `cloudformation:DetectStackDrift` denied  | Attached required IAM permissions to Lambda role           |

## 📝 **Future Enhancements**

✅ To further improve infrastructure monitoring and drift detection:

1. 🟢 **Write a Lambda function** that periodically:

   * Checks CloudWatch logs for changes
   * Or monitors other drift indicators
   * Sends notifications via SES/SNS/Email

2. 🟢 **Implement CI/CD pipeline** (e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or AWS CodePipeline) to:

   * Automatically run `terraform plan` on a schedule
   * Detect drifts programmatically
   * Alert teams on discrepancies
