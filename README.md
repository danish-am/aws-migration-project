# 🏗️ AWS Infrastructure Migration Project using Terraform

This repository contains an end-to-end project for migrating and managing AWS infrastructure
using **Terraform**, including **importing existing resources**, **state management**, and extending
the setup for **drift detection and notifications**.

It documents the process of provisioning infrastructure, importing existing AWS resources into Terraform,
managing Terraform state files, resolving challenges, and setting up CI/CD pipelines or AWS Lambda for monitoring.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

✅ The infrastructure was initially provisioned using Terraform scripts in a folder named
`terraform_old`.

✅ Later, a migration effort was performed to import existing AWS resources into a new
Terraform-managed state in `terraform_new`, using:

- `terraform import`
- a **Python automation script**
- [`Terraformer`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer)

✅ Finally, state files were merged to have a consolidated view of the infrastructure
under Terraform management.

---

## 🏗️ **Phases of the Project**

### 1️⃣ **Initial Provisioning (`terraform_old/`)**

- Infrastructure was first provisioned manually with Terraform in a folder called
  `terraform_old`.
- This included resources like:
  - VPC
  - Subnets
  - Security Groups
  - EC2 Instances
  - RDS
  - EKS Cluster

✅ The infrastructure was successfully deployed using Terraform.

---

### 2️⃣ **Resetting State for Migration**

- To simulate a migration of existing infrastructure, the Terraform state was deleted
  (by removing `terraform.tfstate`), leaving the infrastructure deployed in AWS
  but **untracked by Terraform**.

📝 **Goal:** re-import these resources back into Terraform management.

---


### 3️⃣ **New Project Setup (`terraform_new/`)**

A new folder `terraform_new/` was created to manage the same infrastructure:

✅ New Terraform configuration files were written:
- `main.tf`
- `variables.tf`
- `outputs.tf`
- `provider.tf`
- `terraform.tfvars`

### 💡 **Opportunity for Improvement:**

👉 The Terraform configuration can be further modularized by splitting resources into modules:
- `modules/network`
- `modules/compute`
- `modules/database`
- `modules/eks`

This would improve **reusability, scalability, and maintainability.**

---

## 📥 **Importing Existing Resources**

We used **three approaches** to import existing AWS resources:

---

### 4️⃣ **A. Using `terraform import` command**

✅ Each resource was imported manually:

```bash
terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-xxxxxxxx
terraform import aws_subnet.a subnet-xxxxxxxx
terraform import aws_instance.ec2["web1"] i-xxxxxxxx
...
````

🔍 This approach required mapping every resource to its Terraform configuration.

---

### 5️⃣ **B. Using a Python Script for Automation**

✅ A Python script `import_script.py` was created to automate `terraform import` commands for multiple resources.

🔗 This reduced manual effort, but still required prior knowledge of resource IDs.

---

### 6️⃣ **C. Using Terraformer**

We also used [`Terraformer`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer) — a tool that automatically generates Terraform configuration and state from existing infrastructure.

Installed Terraformer and verified version:

```bash
terraformer --version
```

Ran import command for AWS S3:

```bash
terraformer import aws \
  --resources=s3 \
  --regions=us-east-1 \
  --profile=default \
  --output generated \
  --path-pattern "{output}/{provider}/{service}" \
  --compact \
  -O hcl
```

✅ Generated `.tf` and `terraform.tfstate` files under `generated/aws/s3/`.

---

## 🗃️ **Merging State Files**

We had two state files:

1. `terraform.tfstate` → tracked by Terraform in `terraform_new`
2. `generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate` → generated by Terraformer

### 🛠️ We merged these by:

✅ Listing Terraformer state:

```bash
terraform state list -state=generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate
```

✅ Moving Terraformer resources into main state:

```bash
terraform state mv \
  -state=generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate \
  'aws_s3_bucket.tfer--1-terrraform-migration' \
  'aws_s3_bucket.buckets["1-terrraform-migration"]'
```

✅ Verified merged state:

```bash
terraform state list
```

## ⚠️ **Challenges Faced & Resolutions**

## ⚠️ **Challenges Faced & Resolutions**

Throughout this migration project, we faced several technical challenges across different phases: manual import, Python automation, and Terraformer-generated state.

Below is a detailed breakdown of these challenges and how we resolved them.

---

### ✅ **1. Terraform Import & Python Automation Phase**

We initially attempted to import resources manually using `terraform import`, like:

```bash
terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-xxxxxxxx
terraform import aws_subnet.a subnet-xxxxxxxx
terraform import aws_instance.ec2["web1"] i-xxxxxxxx
````

✅ **Issue:** Manually importing each resource was tedious and error-prone.

👉 **Resolution:** Created an automation script `import_script.py` to batch `terraform import` commands for multiple resources, reading from a predefined list.

✅ **Issue:** Even after importing, some resources required **additional attributes configured in `main.tf`**, or Terraform would mark them for changes.

👉 **Resolution:** Manually updated `main.tf` to include missing attributes (e.g. `tags`, `encryption`, `acl`) to match live AWS configuration.

---

### ✅ **2. Terraformer-generated State Phase**

We used **Terraformer** to auto-generate Terraform configuration + state:

```bash
terraformer import aws --resources=s3 --regions=us-east-1 --output=generated --path-pattern="{output}/{provider}/{service}"
```

Terraformer created:

```
generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate
generated/aws/s3/resources.tf
```

✅ **Issue:** Terraformer-generated resource names had unexpected prefixes like `tfer--1-terraform-migration`.

👉 **Resolution:**

We listed resources from Terraformer’s state:

```bash
terraform state list -state=generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate
```

We used `terraform state mv` to migrate resources from Terraformer’s state into the main Terraform state file:

```bash
terraform state mv \
  -state=generated/aws/s3/terraform.tfstate \
  'aws_s3_bucket.tfer--1-terraform-migration' \
  'aws_s3_bucket.buckets["1-terraform-migration"]'
```

✅ Important: wrapped destination resource address in **quotes** to handle brackets in the name.

---

### ✅ **3. State Merge & Lineage Conflict**

We tried directly merging Terraformer’s state into main state:

```bash
terraform state push merged.tfstate
```

✅ **Issue:** Failed with `lineage mismatch` / `cannot overwrite existing state` errors.

👉 **Resolution:**
Instead of pushing a merged file, we **moved each resource one by one** using `terraform state mv`, which preserved state lineage and prevented corruption.

✅ This kept state integrity while consolidating resources.

---

### ✅ **4. Resource Addressing Syntax**

✅ **Issue:** Errors in `terraform state mv` when importing indexed resources like `aws_s3_bucket.buckets["bucket-name"]`.

👉 **Resolution:**
We wrapped resource addresses in **single quotes** to avoid CLI parsing errors:

```bash
terraform state mv \
  'aws_s3_bucket.tfer--3-terraform-migration' \
  'aws_s3_bucket.buckets["3-terraform-migration"]'
```

✅ Without quotes → Terraform CLI would throw a syntax error.

---

### ✅ **5. Final State Validation**

After migrating all resources:

✅ Ran `terraform state list` to confirm resources successfully transferred into `terraform_new/terraform.tfstate`.

✅ Verified infrastructure consistency with:

```bash
terraform plan
```

🔍 Ensured Terraform showed **“No changes”**, confirming that imported resources matched the Terraform configuration.

---

## 🎯 **Summary Workflow**

1. Initial infrastructure was imported manually via `terraform import` and automated using `import_script.py`.
2. Terraformer generated additional resources + state under `generated/aws/s3/`.
3. We listed Terraformer state resources and mapped them to desired names.
4. Used `terraform state mv` to move resources from Terraformer state → into `terraform_new/terraform.tfstate`.
5. Handled renaming, quoting, lineage conflicts manually.
6. Validated merged state by listing resources and running `terraform plan`.

✅ This enabled **a clean migration into a single consolidated Terraform-managed state file**, with no plan drift.

---
🎉 These resolutions ensured **state integrity, no drift detection issues, and a successful infrastructure migration**.
---

## 📝 **Future Enhancements**

✅ To further improve infrastructure monitoring and drift detection:

1. 🟢 **Write a Lambda function** that periodically:

   * Checks CloudWatch logs for changes
   * Or monitors other drift indicators
   * Sends notifications via SES/SNS/Email

2. 🟢 **Implement CI/CD pipeline** (e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or AWS CodePipeline) to:

   * Automatically run `terraform plan` on a schedule
   * Detect drifts programmatically
   * Alert teams on discrepancies
